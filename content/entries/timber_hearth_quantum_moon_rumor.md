# RUMORS OF THE SIXTH LOCATION

**Audio Log - Hornfels' Notes**

═══════════════════════════════════

*[Static... recording begins]*

**Hornfels**: "Fascinating. I've been cross-referencing the Nomai wall texts across multiple sites, and there's a recurring theme. references to a 'Sixth Location.' Not just five planets in their research scope, but six.

Most texts are fragmentary, but the pattern is consistent. They describe it as... well, this is the strange part. They describe it as existing 'in superposition across five orbital points simultaneously.'

Quantum superposition on a planetary scale? That shouldn't be possible. And yet, the Nomai seemed convinced it was real.

One text fragment mentions: *'To perceive the Sixth Location, one must first understand how to collapse its waveform.'*

I haven't found any concrete coordinates or navigation data yet. Just... rumors, really. Whispers of something impossible orbiting out there in the quantum dark.

If it exists, there must be a way to find it. The Nomai wouldn't have documented something they couldn't reach."

**Ship's Log Note**: The Nomai documented research about a mysterious "Sixth Location" - something called a quantum moon. No frequency or navigation data available yet. Further investigation required.
