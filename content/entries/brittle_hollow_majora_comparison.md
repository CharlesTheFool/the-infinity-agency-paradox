# Quantum Audio Log - Brittle Hollow Tower Archives

*The audio log phases in and out of existence. Stabilize to hear it.*

*[After stabilization, the recording plays]*

**RESEARCHER PYE**: "Comparative analysis log. Temporal loop systems across different realities. I've, uh... identified four distinct approaches to time loop mechanics."

*[Sound of scrolling through data]*

### MAJORA'S MASK: The Mixed Model

"In the Majora's Mask reality, their time loop preserves selective progress:

**What persists**:
- Rupees (via banking system)
- Completed dungeons (permanent unlocks)
- Acquired items (kept in inventory)
- Some NPC relationship progress

**What resets**:
- World state (clock tower, town preparations)
- NPC schedules (restart from day one)
- Physical positions
- Minor quest progress

**Victory condition**: Stop the moon (deontic goal: change outcome)

**Agency type**: Mixed deontic-epistemic
- Mechanical progression enables access
- Understanding NPC schedules improves efficiency
- Ultimate goal is outcome alteration

HYBRID system. Knowledge matters, but mechanical accumulation is primary."

*[Pause, more note-taking]*

### DEATHLOOP: Deontic Optimization

"Deathloop appears epistemic but is fundamentally deontic:

**What persists**:
- Memory of loop events
- Permanent weapon unlocks
- Equipment upgrades
- Slabs and abilities

**What resets**:
- Visionary positions (somewhat)
- World state
- Failed assassinations

**Victory condition**: Break the loop via perfect assassination sequence

**Agency type**: Deontic-focused
- Optimizing an assassination route
- Knowledge helps, mechanical advantage is key
- Goal: perform actions in correct order
- Understanding is a tool for deontic achievement

They call it epistemic. It's about finding the optimal sequence of ACTIONS, not understanding."

*[Sound of frustration]*

### RETURNAL: Roguelike Mechanics Disguised as Loop

"Returnal is barely a time loop at all. It's a roguelike with narrative dressing:

**What persists**:
- Permanent weapon unlock pool
- Some rooms cleared
- Narrative progression gates
- Meta-progression currencies

**What resets**:
- Actual equipment (start weak each run)
- Enemy positions
- Health/resources

**Victory condition**: Reach end boss with enough power

**Agency type**: Purely mechanical progression
- Knowledge of layouts helps minimally
- Challenge is execution + RNG
- Understanding narrative is optional
- Progression through power accumulation

Not epistemic. Traditional roguelike difficulty using time loop aesthetic."

*[Long pause, contemplative]*

### OUTER WILDS: Pure Epistemic Loop

"Our reality. The true epistemic loop:

**What persists**: Knowledge ONLY
- Ship's log entries
- Understanding of systems
- Comprehension of relationships
- Synthesis of patterns

**What resets**: EVERYTHING physical
- All items, positions, states
- NPC locations
- Environmental states
- Player capabilities (no upgrades ever)

**Victory condition**: Understand the system well enough to navigate to the Eye

**Agency type**: Pure epistemic
- No mechanical progression
- No power accumulation
- No permanent unlocks except understanding
- Victory through comprehension alone

Pure epistemic loop."

*[Sound of realization]*

### The Critical Distinction: Memory vs. Knowledge

"There's a subtlety here that matters. When I say 'knowledge persists,' I don't mean MEMORY.

**Memory Persistence** (Deathloop, Returnal): Remembering facts for optimization. Recalling locations, timings, weaknesses. Using memory as tool for mechanical advantage. Goal: Execute optimal sequence.

**Knowledge Persistence** (Outer Wilds): Understanding systems and relationships. Synthesizing meaning from distributed fragments. Achieving conceptual breakthroughs. Goal: Comprehend the mystery.

Memory is STORAGE. Knowledge is SYNTHESIS.

Most 'knowledge-based' loop games are actually memory-based. They require you to remember information for optimization, not understand systems for enlightenment."

*[Pause]*

"To create true epistemic agency, you have to eliminate deontic accumulation entirely. Even small systems like Majora's banking create optimization pressure that pulls focus from understanding. When nothing persists except knowledge, we're forced to engage with comprehension itself."
