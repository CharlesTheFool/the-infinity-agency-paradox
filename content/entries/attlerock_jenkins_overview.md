## JENKINS' FOUR ARCHITECTURES OF ENVIRONMENTAL STORYTELLING

Recording this mid-afternoon, I think. Hard to judge time on Attlerock without the sun visible.

We, The Nomai discovered a framework for understanding how physical spaces convey narrative. Scholar Henry Jenkins identified four distinct patterns.

---

### 1. EVOCATIVE SPACES

Evocative spaces function through the knowledge bridge: the gap between environmental cue and narrative meaning that the observer fills with their own understanding. Without this external knowledge, the environments remain merely pretty.

---

### 2. EMBEDDED NARRATIVES

Environmental elements that tell stories through arrangement and archaeology.

Our civilization's story is spatially distributed: text fragments revealing conversations and failures, skeletal remains showing simultaneous death, ruins demonstrating technological scale, abandoned warp cores and crashed vessels, ghost matter trails from the Interloper. Understanding requires visiting multiple locations and synthesizing information across space.

---

### 3. EMERGENT NARRATIVES

The unique investigation path each explorer creates.

Your personal narrative includes discovery sequence (finding Solanum early vs. late changes emotional impact), navigation mistakes that teach (crashing into hazards, learning physics), "aha" moments unique to your understanding progression, and the story of how you solved the mystery. Two explorers create radically different narratives despite identical content.

---

### 4. ENACTED NARRATIVES

Moments of explorer-driven realization achieved through environmental engagement. These aren't cutscene revelations but epistemic achievements: understanding the Ash Twin/Ember Twin sand transfer mechanism, successfully navigating to the Quantum Moon's sixth location, standing on the Sun Station realizing the Nomai failed, choosing to enter the Eye despite uncertainty.

---

Jenkins argued environmental storytelling supports but doesn't replace traditional narrative. Outer Wilds inverts this. Environment is (well, becomes) the epistemic structure. The spatial distribution of information creates the possibility space. Each planet is a node, each discovery a connection. Your ship traverses epistemic space disguised as physical space.

### The Knowledge Graph Made Navigable

Consider how the Ash Twin Project makes no sense without understanding the Sun Station exists (orbital station), it failed (inscriptions there), we needed an alternative (desperation texts), and the probe needed millions of attempts (statistical texts). These fragments are on different planets. To comprehend the Ash Twin Project, you must navigate physical space. The solar system isn't just setting. it's a knowledge graph made navigable through spaceship flight.

### Mechanical Consonance

This environmental design achieves what Larsen and Schoenau-Fog call "ludonarrative consonance." Your tools (signalscope, scout launcher, translator) all serve investigation. You explore, read, observe, photograph, and listen. The game rewards investigation, synthesis, and understanding. Complete alignment between mechanical affordances and narrative goals.
