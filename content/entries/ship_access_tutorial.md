ENTER LAUNCH CODE: _________

[The Observatory may contain relevant information]

═══════════════════════════════════════

This security system demonstrates a core principle
of Nomai technology:

Access is granted through understanding, not through
physical keys or possessions.

Knowledge persists. Objects do not.

The launch code will remain in your memory even
after temporal resets. Once understood, this
knowledge cannot be taken from you.

╚══════════════════════════════════════╝

✓ Code accepted: EPISTEMIC

SYSTEMS ONLINE:
- Navigation computer: ACTIVE
- Ship's log database: SYNCED
- Autopilot: STANDBY
- Quantum stabilization sensors: READY

You now have access to all locations in this
solar system.

Knowledge gained during exploration will persist
across time loop resets. Your understanding is the
only permanent progress.

Use this capability wisely.
