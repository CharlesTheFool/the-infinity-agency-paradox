## EVOCATIVE SPACES: NARRATIVES FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CUES

The first architecture we discovered: evocative spaces that conjure narratives through environmental design and the explorer's external knowledge framework.

### The Knowledge Prerequisite

Environments that conjure narratives through environmental cues and the player's external knowledge. 

The game assumes you understand quantum mechanics (Schrödinger's Cat principles), orbital mechanics and astronomy, archaeological investigation methods, existential philosophy. The Quantum Moon "makes sense" only if you understand superposition. The solar system's scale becomes meaningful when you recognize realistic orbital physics. 

No player needs to get a PhD in astrophysics, but all players must synthesize their pre-conceptions with the game's physical languange to properly traverse it; both physically AND conceptually, narratively.

### Examples in This Solar System

**The Interloper's Frozen Core**:
Visual cues (cracked ice, ghost matter wisps) evoke disaster narratives if you understand what ghost matter indicates, what a comet's frozen interior implies, and how rapid sublimation creates catastrophic gas release.

The environment doesn't tell you the story. it provides cues that your knowledge framework interprets into narrative.

**The Quantum Moon's Six Locations**:
Only comprehensible if you grasp quantum superposition. The moon doesn't explain itself. It performs quantum behavior and trusts you'll recognize the pattern.

**The Sun Station's Isolation**:
Architectural placement (difficult orbit requiring gravity cannon) combined with abandoned state evokes failure narrative if you understand what such a station might attempt, why isolation suggests secretive experimentation, and how abandonment implies unsuccessful outcome.

### The Evocative Contract

Evocative spaces make a deal with explorers: I'll provide environmental detail rich with implication. You provide the knowledge framework to decode it into story. The Nomai never explain obvious connections. they trust you'll make the conceptual leaps. Different explorers construct different narratives from identical spaces based on their external knowledge.

### Connection to Epistemic Agency

Evocative spaces create interpretation agency: you decide what the environment means based on your framework. Two explorers can stand in the same location and construct different narratives. The environment provides facts. You provide meaning. The gap between fact and meaning is where epistemic agency lives.
