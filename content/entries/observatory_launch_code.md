# Audio Log - Observatory Console

*You activate the Observatory's audio recording system. A young researcher's voice plays:*

**RESEARCHER MALLOW**: "Log 2847. Late afternoon probably. I've been cross-referencing orbital data with the Nomai texts, and I found something weird."

*[Sound of text scrolling]:* "This recording device is still a piece of shit, by the way."*

"Okay, so. The Nomai kept mentioning a 'sixth location' in their quantum research notes. At first I thought it was a mistranslation. We've got five planets, right? Timber Hearth, the Attlerock, Brittle Hollow, and the two outer ones."

"But the math doesn't add up. There's this... gravitational anomaly. Not constant. It flickers in and out of detection. Quantum superposition at orbital scale."

*[Pause]*

"The texts say it exists in six locations simultaneously. Which is insane. But also... kind of brilliant? If you could observe it correctly, you'd have access to something the Nomai were obsessed with."

*[Sound of paper rustling]*

"They called it the Quantum Moon. Mentioned someone named Solanum who went there. Never came back, I think? The translations get fuzzy."

"Anyway, I'm logging this because if anyone figures out how to perceive it—actually see through the quantum interference—it'll be huge. Might rewrite everything we think we know about observation and reality."

*[Background]: "MALLOW GET OFF THE DAMN RECORDER"*

"Yeah, yeah, I'm coming!"

**DISCOVERY LOGGED: THE SIXTH LOCATION**

*The Nomai theorized a quantum object in superposition across six orbital states. Observable only through specific techniques.*

You stare at the notes scattered across the console. Orbital diagrams. Quantum wave equations. References to a grove, a traveler, a final location.

Somewhere out there, something shifts between possibilities.

Waiting to be observed.
