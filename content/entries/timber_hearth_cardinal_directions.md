# QUANTUM MOON NAVIGATION PROTOCOL

**Nomai Inscription - Observatory Wall**

═══════════════════════════════════

The Sixth Location orbits possibility,\
A moon that dwells in six states simultaneously.\
To reach the grove where quantum trees take root,\
Walk not with feet, but observation's route.

**I.**

Turn toward the crystals, hear their ancient song,\
Harmonics shifting where the tones belong.\
Their frequencies dance with each watching eye—\
First step toward the grove beneath quantum sky.

**II.**

Walk beneath the boughs that phase through time,\
Silver bark that shifts with reason, not with rhyme.\
The ancient tree whose roots drink memory's well—\
Second step along the path that none can tell.

**III.**

Face the arch where light breaks into truth,\
Prismatic colors bending without proof.\
The stone that fractures starlight into parts—\
Third step that quantum navigation charts.

**IV.**

Then turn to face the footsteps you have made,\
Look back along the path your watching laid.\
Your history written in quantum dust—\
Fourth step that closes what observation thrust.

**V.**

Now close your eyes to see what lies beyond,\
The grove exists because you made this bond.\
Not forward into mystery, but back—\
Understanding is the final track.

*The sixth location shifts between all states.*\
*To reach it, one must be the observer who creates.*
