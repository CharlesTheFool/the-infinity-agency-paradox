## THE TIME LOOP AS EPISTEMIC RESET

The 22-minute loop is the **fundamental design constraint** that enables pure epistemic agency by eliminating deontic accumulation.

---

## HOW THE LOOP FUNCTIONS

Every cycle:
1. Triggers automatically after 22 minutes when the sun goes supernova
2. Resets ALL physical state (planets, travelers, items, positions)
3. Preserves ONLY: explorer knowledge + ship log entries
4. Cannot be extended, broken, or modified
5. Death simply accelerates the reset

An **iterative epistemic narrative form**: repeated engagement with identical content, differentiated comprehension.

## ELIMINATING DEONTIC ACCUMULATION

Traditional progression systems reward deontic actions:

**Returnal**: Unlock permanent weapon upgrades through runs
**Hades**: Permanent currency allows meta-progression
**Deathloop**: Optimize assassination routes via trial and error

All of them preserve mechanical advantages. Which is fine, whatever, but it's not what we're doing here.

**Outer Wilds preserves NOTHING except understanding**.

---

## WHAT YOU CANNOT DO

The loop prevents all traditional progression mechanics:
- Stockpile resources for later loops? No.
- Build persistent structures? Hell no.
- Form/break relationships over time? Mostly, not really.
- Unlock permanent abilities? Barely.
- Optimize loadouts or builds? Nah.
- Gain mechanical power upgrades? Nope

Every loop is mechanically identical. Jetpack fuel? Same. Ship modifications? None.

**Knowledge is the only variable.**

## CREATING UNDERSTANDING NECESSITY

The loop makes comprehension **mechanically necessary**. Not encouraged. necessary.

- Can't brute-force solutions (they reset)
- Can't skip exposition (you need it)
- Can't rely on piloting skill alone (knowledge gates access)

Accessing the Ash Twin Project: piloting expertise means nothing without understanding the sand column timing. The system demands comprehension, not pattern memorization.

### Why 22 Minutes

The duration isn't arbitrary. Too short (5 minutes) and you can't meaningfully investigate. Too long (2 hours) and the temptation to stockpile or optimize returns. 22 minutes forces you to prioritize each loop. You can't exhaustively explore everything, so you must decide what matters now. Long enough to feel un-rushed, short enough to maintain focus. Early loop becomes travel time, late loop becomes high-stakes moments.

### Temporal Gating Through Physics

Some locations are temporally gated by physics, not artificial locks:

**Ash Twin Project** (accessible only final 7 minutes): Sand column requires specific timing. Can't brute-force entry. Must understand sand transfer mechanics.

**Brittle Hollow surface** (degrades over loop): Fragments fall into black hole progressively. Early loop = surface access, late loop = hollowed interior.

**Giant's Deep islands** (surface periodically): Tornado mechanics create timing windows. Must understand cyclone patterns.

Not "door locked until you find key." Physics creating access windows. Understanding the physics means understanding the access pattern.

## THE PARADIGM SHIFT

Difficulty curves invert:

**Traditional games**: Mechanically hard early, easier as you gain power
**Outer Wilds**: Epistemically dense early, clearer as understanding accretes

Challenge shifts from execution to synthesis. Not a value judgment, just different design goals.

---

## THE LOOP AS CONVERSATIONAL STRUCTURE

This iterative structure maps to Chris Crawford's model of interactive storytelling as "Listen-Think-Speak" conversation.

- **Listen**: Observe environmental clues, read Nomai text, witness phenomena
- **Think**: Synthesize knowledge across loops, recognize patterns, form hypotheses
- **Speak**: Choose next investigation priority based on understanding

Each loop is one "turn" in an ongoing conversation with the mystery. The same content supports different "conversations" based on what you already know.

Loop 1: The Ash Twin Project means nothing. Loop 20: It means everything, but only after you've discovered the Sun Station failed, time loops are possible, the Nomai were desperate, the probe cannon needed 9+ million attempts.

---

## THE LEARNING MECHANISM

Koster describes learning as: Challenge → Practice → Mastery. Traditional games apply this to execution (hard enemy, learn patterns, execute perfectly). This system applies it to cognition (mystery, investigation, understanding). Both create the "click" of mastery in different domains.

The loop is essential. Without reset, you'd stockpile clues and solve through exhaustive collection. The loop forces genuine understanding because **you can't outsource cognition to your inventory**.

### Balancing Cognitive Load

Koster's Triangle of Weirdness suggests games can make 1-2 elements "weird" but risk confusion if all three are unfamiliar. This solar system's balance: character is familiar (curious explorer), world is weird (quantum mechanics, time loops), activities are familiar (fly, read, observe, explore). This leaves cognitive bandwidth available for understanding the weird elements.
