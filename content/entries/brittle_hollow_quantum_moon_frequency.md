# THE SIXTH LOCATION: QUANTUM MOON

**Nomai Inscription - Quantum Cavern**

═══════════════════════════════════

The Quantum Moon exists in superposition across five orbital positions simultaneously. To navigate to it, one must PERCEIVE it. lock its waveform using the navigation frequency.

## QUANTUM MOON FREQUENCY

**[5555]** - QUANTUM MOON

This frequency does not transmit sound like the other travelers' signals. It transmits POSSIBILITY. Your signal scope will use it to collapse the moon's location relative to your observation point.

Your ship's navigation system automatically logs this frequency. It will persist across time loops, enabling you to navigate to the Quantum Moon. Quantum knowledge endures.

## WARNING: NAVIGATION HAZARD

The moon's surface exhibits extreme quantum behavior. Traditional navigation will fail. Walking in any direction may loop you back to your starting point.

**Riebeck's Note**: *"I tried exploring the moon. Got completely lost. every path seemed to circle back on itself. There must be a specific way to navigate it. The Observatory on Timber Hearth might have a protocol..."*

The Sixth Location responds to OBSERVATION. Understanding HOW to look is as important as WHERE to look.
