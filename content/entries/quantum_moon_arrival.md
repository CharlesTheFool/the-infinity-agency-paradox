# The Quantum Moon - Sixth Location

---

You've reached the sixth location. the one that exists at the Eye of the Universe's quantum reflection. Impossible vegetation grows here. And there, among the ancient trees...

**A Nomai.**

Alive. After 280,000 years.

**SOLANUM**: "Hello, traveler. I've been waiting here for... well, time works differently at the Eye's reflection. Moments and eternities. Simultaneously. Honestly I've lost track completely."

She gestures to the quantum grove around you.

**SOLANUM**: "I survived because I was here when the comet that arrived unannounced and wrought the destruction of my people appeared. The quantum moon's superposition protected me. I existed in all six locations at once. Only this one, at the Eye, was safe."

**SOLANUM**: "You've traveled far to reach this place. The quantum mechanics required to navigate here... you understand them."

**SOLANUM**: "But I sense you haven't explored everything yet. There's knowledge scattered across this dying solar system. inscriptions my people left, systems we built, secrets we discovered."

**SOLANUM**: "Return when you've gathered more understanding. I have insights to share, but they'll mean more when you've seen what needs seeing."

**SOLANUM**: "I'll be here. I've been here for 280,000 years. A few more loops won't matter."

*[She pauses]* "Actually that's probably not comforting. Sorry."
