# The Quantum Moon - Sixth Location

*You navigate through quantum uncertainty and arrive at a grove bathed in ethereal light.*

---

The Quantum Moon stabilizes around you. You've reached the sixth location. the one that exists at the Eye of the Universe's quantum reflection.

Impossible vegetation grows here, sustained by quantum probability. The air shimmers with superposition.

And there, among the ancient trees...

**A Nomai.**

Alive. After 280,000 years.

**SOLANUM**: "Hello, traveler. I've been waiting here for... well, time works differently at the Eye's reflection. Moments and eternities. Simultaneously. Honestly I've lost track completely."

She gestures to the quantum grove around you.

**SOLANUM**: "I survived because I was here when the Interloper released its ghost matter. The quantum moon's superposition protected me. I existed in all six locations at once. Only this one, at the Eye, was safe."

*She looks at you with ancient eyes.*

**SOLANUM**: "You've traveled far to reach this place. The quantum mechanics required to navigate here... you understand them."

**SOLANUM**: "But I sense you haven't explored everything yet. There's knowledge scattered across this dying solar system. inscriptions my people left, systems we built, secrets we discovered."

*The quantum grove pulses gently.*

**SOLANUM**: "Return when you've gathered more understanding. I have insights to share, but they'll mean more when you've seen what needs seeing."

**SOLANUM**: "I'll be here. I've been here for 280,000 years. A few more loops won't matter."

*[She pauses]* "Actually that's probably not comforting. Sorry."

---

Solanum stands among the quantum trees, patient as stone, ancient as starlight.

She has insights about this solar system. about how the Nomai explored, how they learned, how understanding drove them forward across the cosmos. The quantum grove pulses. She'll be here when you're ready.

*You can now talk with Solanum using the dialogue system.*
