# Audio Log - Attlerock Research Station

*An old Nomai audio log crackles to life:*

**RESEARCHER RIVIK**: "Discovery log, day 47. Forty-seven fucking days. I've finally figured it out!"

"These quantum inscriptions... The ones that flicker and phase in and out of existence? They're not broken or corrupted. They're in quantum superposition!"

*[Excited rustling of equipment]*

"The text exists in multiple states simultaneously! Every time you observe it, the waveform collapses into ONE state—but it might not be the readable state."

"Here's the key: quantum objects change when you STOP observing them. When you turn off the lights o-or close your eyes, the text shifts to a different state. When you open your eyes again, you're observing a new configuration."

*[Sound of quantum text shifting]*

"So the technique is simple but requires patience: shift in between states until, eventually, you'll observe it with the encryption key symbol!"

*[Pause]*

"Each quantum state has a unique symbol. ⟁, ⧈, ◊, ∞, ◈... But only ONE symbol acts as the encryption key."

"It's ⟐. That's the symbol you're looking for."

*[Sound of successful observation]*

"This changes everything. There are quantum texts scattered across the solar system, probably containing advanced knowledge we've been unable to access. Now we can read them all!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA"

*[Log ends]*
