# Audio Log - Attlerock Research Station

*An old Nomai audio log crackles to life:*

---

**RESEARCHER RIVIK**: "Discovery log, day 47. Forty-seven fucking days. I've finally figured it out!"

"Quantum inscription encryption! Text that exists in superposition, flickering between multiple states. Anyone observing it sees it collapse into ONE state, but it might not be the readable one!"

*[Excited rustling of equipment]*

"The brilliance is this: quantum objects change when you STOP observing them. Turn off the lights, close your eyes, and the text shifts to a different state. Open your eyes again and you're seeing a new configuration."

"Here's how someone would decrypt it: they'd need patience to cycle through states until they observe the encryption key symbol!"

*[Sound of quantum text shifting]*

"Each quantum state displays a unique symbol. ⟁, ⧈, ◊, ∞, ◈... But only ONE symbol is the encryption key."

*[Pause to breath]*

"I'm using ⟐ as the key. Anyone who knows what to look for can decrypt it, but casual observers just see flickering nonsense."

"This changes everything! We can hide advanced knowledge throughout the solar system. Protected, but accessible to those who understand quantum mechanics. Now we can safeguard our most important discoveries!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA"

*[Log ends]*
