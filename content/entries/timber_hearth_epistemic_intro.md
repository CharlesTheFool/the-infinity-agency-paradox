# Nomai Wall Inscription - Near Campfire

## THE EPISTEMIC FRAMEWORK

If agency exists through understanding navigation rather than outcome control, entire catagories of experiences become newly analyzable.

*[Mallow's addendum: "catagories" really? proofread your inscriptions]*

Walking simulators. Puzzle experiences. Exploration-focused designs. They're not "agency-lite" versions of choice-driven narratives. they may be optimizing for a different form of agency entirely.

## WHAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING

*Outer Wilds* challenges conventional understanding. The game offers exactly one outcome. the universe ends. You cannot save the Nomai. You cannot stop the supernova. You cannot change the fundamental narrative.

Yet explorers consistently report feelings of agency and authorship.

Why?

You are navigating epistemic space. the space of possible understanding pathways. Your investigation format demonstrates the thesis: you have agency over your journey to comprehension, not over the destination. This is what traditional frameworks miss.

## THE PATH FORWARD

As you explore this solar system, pay attention to what creates your sense of agency.

Changing outcomes? You cannot.
Choosing which mysteries to investigate? You can.
Deciding what to understand next? You control this completely.

Your ship's log will track your unique investigation sequence. No two explorers take the same path. Yet all arrive at the same truth.

That paradox is the thesis.

Inscription complete. Moving to the Observatory next. More wall space there.
