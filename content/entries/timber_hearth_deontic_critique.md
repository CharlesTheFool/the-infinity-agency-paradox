# Nomai Wall Inscription - Village Ruins

## THE DEONTIC ILLUSION

We have studied countless civilizations across the galaxy. Most species make the same mistake: they conflate agency with outcome control.

Outer Wilds challenges how civilizations conceptualize meaningful choice. Traditional narrative experiences emphasize branching paths and multiple outcomes. This universe offers exactly one ending. Entropy. The heat death is inevitable. The Nomai civilization is gone. we perished 280,000 years ago. You cannot stop the supernova. It's the sun's natural conclusion.

Yet travelers consistently report feelings of agency and authorship over their experience.

This exposes the **Categorical Error**: treating agency as outcome manipulation rather than something else entirely.

## THE DEONTIC FRAMEWORK ASSUMPTION

Most frameworks for analyzing meaningful choice assume what we term **deontic agency**. the ability to choose what to DO, with those choices affecting tangible results.

Take Narain's Nine Choice Types, which all measure consequence variance: hollow choices lack real impact, obvious choices present a clear optimal path, weighted choices involve moral complexity in outcomes, dramatic choices create high-stakes consequences (there are like five more). They all presuppose that meaningful choice requires differentiated outcomes.

The "Meaningful Choice" Framework requires three elements: understanding of options, consequence that matters, and differentiation between outcomes. But "consequence" here means *causal* impact on the world. This framework struggles when understanding itself becomes the meaningful variable.

Traditional Possibility Space Analysis measures action options at decision points. By this metric, experiences with 40 endings have higher possibility space than experiences with 1 ending.

True enough. But the metric only captures deontic dimensionality.

## THE COMPARISON PROBLEM

*Life is Strange* offers approximately 40 distinct endings based on choices. *Detroit: Become Human* boasts thousands of permutations. Both score high on traditional agency metrics.

Yet most endings differ only in final sequences. The core narrative understanding remains relatively constant across playthroughs. Players optimize for "good" outcomes rather than exploring epistemic possibilities.

Meanwhile, *Outer Wilds* offers one ending. But infinite understanding pathways.

Two explorers can finish with radically different comprehension of quantum mechanics principles, the Nomai's ultimate goals, the relationship between the time loop and the Ash Twin Project, and the significance of the Eye of the Universe.

We must measure possibility space in multiple dimensions.

*Life is Strange*: High deontic variance, low epistemic variance
*Outer Wilds*: Low deontic variance, infinite epistemic variance

Here's a chart containing only objective, observable facts of reality that were NOT pulled out of our asses:

| Experience | Authored Endings | Understanding Paths | Dimensionality |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Life is Strange | ~40 | Low | High deontic, low epistemic |
| Detroit: Become Human | 1000s | Low | High deontic, low epistemic |
| Minecraft | 0 (sandbox) | Infinite | Pure systemic |
| Outer Wilds | 1 | Lots TBH | Pure epistemic |

Which sounds way more pretentious than I intended but the point stands.
