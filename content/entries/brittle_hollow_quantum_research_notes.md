# QUANTUM PERCEPTION RESEARCH

**Nomai Research Notes - The Tower**

═══════════════════════════════════

## OBSERVATIONS ON QUANTUM PHENOMENA

The Nomai researchers here documented extensive studies of quantum superposition across multiple locations. Their notes mention "quantum caverns" - spaces that exist in uncertain states until properly observed.

## PERCEPTION REQUIREMENTS

*"Traditional observation is insufficient. The quantum realm requires trained perception: a technique to stabilize superposed states and reveal hidden locations."*

One researcher notes: *"We've identified similar stabilization protocols at our research outpost on Timber Hearth's moon. The techniques there may be applicable to perceiving quantum spaces elsewhere."*

## HIDDEN LOCATIONS

Multiple entries reference a "hidden chamber" near this tower - a quantum cavern that contains crucial research about the Sixth Location. However, the cavern's entrance remains imperceptible without proper quantum observation techniques.

**Recommendation**: If you cannot perceive additional locations here, investigate the Attlerock research station. The Nomai there were developing quantum stabilization methods that may unlock your perception of hidden spaces.

*The path forward requires understanding how to SEE, not just where to LOOK.*
