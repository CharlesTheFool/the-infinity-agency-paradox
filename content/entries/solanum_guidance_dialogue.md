# Solanum's Grove - Guidance Systems Discussion

*Solanum examines your ship's log interface with fascination.*

---

**YOU**: "Tell me about guidance systems."

**SOLANUM**: "You experienced a paradox: 'I always knew what to investigate next' and 'I could explore anything I wanted.' How can guidance feel both clear and open?"

*She points to your ship's log display.*

**SOLANUM**: "The Rumor Mode system. My people's greatest UI achievement."

## The Rumor Mode Philosophy

**SOLANUM**: "Your ship's log is procedurally constructed based on your discoveries. It displays what you've learned, connections between discoveries, unanswered questions highlighted, locations with unexplored areas.

It does not show solutions to puzzles, optimal investigation paths, quest markers pointing where to go next, required next steps.

Pinchbeck's work on computer-generated narrative applies here. Rumor Mode generates personalized guidance that feels hand-crafted but emerges from system state.

Two explorers' ship logs look completely different while serving identical function: surfacing questions based on current understanding."

## Environmental Telegraphing Creates Curiosity

**SOLANUM**: "The solar system guides through questions, not imperatives:

**Visual telegraphing**:
- Giant's Deep's tornados (unmissable from space → investigation prompt)
- Nomai structures architecturally prominent (designed to catch attention)
- Hollow's Lantern's geysers (visible → curiosity target)

**Audio telegraphing**:
- Traveler instruments tracked via signalscope
- Distress beacons from escape pods
- Quantum fluctuation sounds

**Epistemic telegraphing**:
- Rumor Mode's '???' markers
- Incomplete text fragment chains
- Raised questions from discoveries

Together these create what I call curiosity-driven waypoints.

You're not commanded where to go. you're intrigued into investigating."

## Comparison: Guidance Philosophies

**SOLANUM**: "Different systems create different agency experiences:

### Quest Markers (Skyrim, Assassin's Creed):
Prescriptive: 'Go here next'. Optimal path implied. Exploration becomes checklist completion. High guidance, low discovery agency.

### Map Fog (Zelda: Breath of the Wild):
Towers reveal map regions. Shrines and locations visible once uncovered. Visual targets provided without sequencing. Higher discovery agency than quest markers.

### Dialogue Gates (Mass Effect, Life is Strange):
Information locked behind specific conversations. Must exhaust dialogue trees to progress. Linear epistemic paths despite branching choices. Moderate guidance, moderate agency.

### Emergent Questions (Outer Wilds):
Systems surface questions based on current knowledge. Multiple valid next steps always available. Player priorities determine path. Low prescription, high discovery agency.

I could keep going but you get the idea."

*She gestures.*

**SOLANUM**: "The distinction matters. Traditional guidance says:

'Go to Location X' (command)

Our guidance says:

'What's inside Dark Bramble?' (curiosity)

You're drawn to mysteries, not commanded to solve them in sequence. This preserves epistemic agency."

## The Freedom Paradox Resolved

**SOLANUM**: "You felt both guided and free because guidance created questions, not imperatives.

The '???' markers in your ship's log are invitations, not obligations. Unanswered questions become opportunities rather than requirements. Unexplored areas remain choices, not mandates.

The game respects your priorities. Want to chase the quantum mysteries? Valid. Want to understand the time loop first? Also valid. Want to explore Dark Bramble before anything else? Dangerous, but valid!

Extra Credits' pacing framework usually requires authored control over content timing. Our system inverts this: pacing is explorer-controlled. Speedrunners complete in 6 minutes. Methodical investigators take 40+ hours."

## Rouse & Abernathy: Player Journey Over Plot

**SOLANUM**: "Richard Rouse and Robert Abernathy argue players remember their journey, not plot beats.

Our system optimizes for memorable personal moments over prescribed emotional arcs.

Your story isn't:
- Act 1: Learn flying
- Act 2: Discover Nomai
- Act 3: Solve mystery

Your story is your unique investigation sequence.

Some explorers have heartbreaking encounters with me early. Meeting the lone survivor before understanding the tragedy's scale.

Others discover my existence in final hours. A... profound reunion after grasping the full extinction event."

---

## The Agency of Not Knowing

**SOLANUM**: "Our solar system makes not knowing feel agentive.

Unanswered questions aren't frustration. they're targets for investigation.
The ship log's '???' markers aren't failures. they're opportunities.

Traditional games punish not knowing (die to enemy, fail quest).

This solar system makes not knowing the engine of engagement. Every unknown is an adventure waiting to happen, chosen by you based on your curiosity.

That's epistemic agency: control over your journey to understanding."

*She smiles.*

**SOLANUM**: "You felt agency not because you chose outcomes, but because you chose pathways.

The guidance respected that choice. It surfaced possibilities without prescribing sequence.

And that made all the difference."
